TOMCAT CONFIGURATION AND SERVLET PROGRAMMING
To run servlet program you need two thing
1. Set CLASSPATH for tomcat
2. Create web.xml file
To configure your tomcat go to your Tomcat folder->lib see if there is servlet-api.jar file in the folder and copy it to the environment variables
The path should be as follows for Tomcat in environment variables\system variables
Variable Name: CLASSPATH
Variable Path: your_Tomcat_location\lib\servlet-api.jar
To set the path right click on computer go to properties.In left-side go to Advanced windows settings then go environment variables and then set the path in system variables
Set the java path and JAVA_home path in environmwent variables
Path is your_java_folder/jdk/bin
And JAVA_HOME is your_java_folder/jdk/
Set these three paths and check if your tomcat is running
To run tomcat go to bin of tomcat see for startup.bat file and run it
now see if your tomcat is running on your browser using localhost:8080
To run servlet program first complie the program from anywhere in your pc.
If the class file is created copy that file and paste in your “tomcat/webapps/projname/WEB-INF/classes “ folder

create the web.xml file in “tomcat/webapps/projname/WEB-INF”

HOW TO CREATE XML FILE??
<web-app>
<servlet>
<servlet-name>test</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>DemoServ</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>test</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/hi</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
</web-app>

DemoServ.java
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import java.io.*;
public class DemoServ extends HttpServlet
{
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req,HttpServletResponse res)throws ServletException,IOException
{
res.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw=res.getWriter();
String name=req.getParameter("name");
pw.println("Welcome "+name);
}
}

HOW TO RUN SERVLET PROGRAM.
1. To run servlet program you Here <servlet-name> can be anything in my case it is raj.It can be a,b,c or anything you want
2. In <servlet-class> you have to write the class file name that was compiled

5. Remember in url-pattern just give the / as shown above
need to things
1. Class file
2. Web.xml file
Now go to browser and type localhost: 8080 and see if your tomcat is running
If yes type the following:
Localhost:8080/your_project_name/your url-pattern name
As per above xml file it should be as follows:
Localhost:8080/your_project_name/hi
